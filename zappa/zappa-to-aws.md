# zappa to aws

## zappa deploy

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

## zappa update

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

## zappa tail

```bash
$ zappa tail production --since 4h # 4 hours
$ zappa tail production --since 1m # 1 minute
$ zappa tail production --since 1mm # 1 month
```
