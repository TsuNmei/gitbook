# Linux

## What is Linux ?

> **Linux** is an open source operating system \(OS\). It was originally conceived of and created as a hobby by --_**Linus Torvalds**_ ****in 1991. Linus, while at university, sought to create an **alternative, free, open source** version of the MINIX operating system, which was itself based on the principles and design of Unix. That hobby has since become the OS with the largest user base, the most-used OS on publicly available internet servers, and the only OS used on the top 500 fastest supercomputers.
